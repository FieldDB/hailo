NAME
    Hailo - A pluggable Markov engine analogous to MegaHAL

SYNOPSIS
        use 5.10.0;
        use Hailo;

        my $hailo = Hailo->new(
            # Or Pg, or Perl ...
            storage_class  => 'SQLite',
            brain_resource => 'brain.storable'
        );

        while (<>) {
            $hailo->learn($_);
            say $hailo->reply($_);
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Hailo is a fast and pluggable markov engine intended to replace
    AI::MegaHAL, it has a lightweight Moose-based core with pluggable
    storage backends and tokenizers. It's faster than MegaHAL and can handle
    huge brains easily with the recommended SQLite backend.

    It can be used, amongst other things, to implement IRC chat bots with
    POE::Component::IRC.

  Etymology
    *Hailo* is a portmanteau of *HAL* (as in MegaHAL) and <*failo*>

ATTRIBUTES
  "brain_resource"
    The name of the resource (file name, database name) to use as storage.
    There is no default.

  "order"
    The Markov order (chain length) you want to use for an empty brain. The
    default is 5.

  "storage"
    The storage backend to use. Default: 'SQLite'.

  "tokenizer"
    The tokenizer to use. Default: 'Words';

  "boundary_token"
    The token used to signify a paragraph boundary. Has to be something that
    would never appear in your inputs. Defaults to "\012" (linefeed).

  "token_separator"
    Storage backends may choose to store the tokens of an expression as a
    single string. If so, they will be joined them together with a
    separator. By default, this is "\t".

METHODS
  "new"
    This is the constructor. It accept the attributes specified in
    "ATTRIBUTES".

  "run"
    Run the application according to the command line arguments.

  "learn"
    Takes a line of UTF-8 encoded text as input and learns from it.

  "train"
    Takes a filename and calls "learn" on all its lines. Lines are expected
    to be UTF-8 encoded.

  "reply"
    Takes a line of text and generates a reply (UTF-8 encoded) that might be
    relevant.

  "save"
    Tells the underlying storage backend to save its state.

CAVEATS
    "boundary_token" and "token_separator" will be stripped from your input
    before it is processed, so make sure those are set to something that is
    unlikely to appear in it.
