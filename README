NAME
    Hailo - A pluggable Markov engine analogous to MegaHAL

SYNOPSIS
        use 5.10.0;
        use Hailo;

        my $hailo = Hailo->new(
            # Or Pg, or Perl ...
            storage_class => 'SQLite',
            brain   => 'brain.storable'
        );

        while (<>) {
            $hailo->learn($_);
            say $hailo->reply($_);
        }

DESCRIPTION
    Hailo is a fast and pluggable markov engine intended to replace
    AI::MegaHAL, it has a lightweight Moose-based core with pluggable
    storage backends and tokenizers. It's faster than MegaHAL and can handle
    huge brains easily with the recommended SQLite backend.

    It can be used, amongst other things, to implement IRC chat bots with
    POE::Component::IRC.

ATTRIBUTES
  "file"
    Path to the file you want the storage backend to save/load its state
    to/from. There is no default.

  "order"
    The Markov order (chain length) you want to use for an empty brain. The
    default is 5.

  "storage"
    The storage backend to use. Default: 'SQLite'.

  "tokenizer"
    The tokenizer to use. Default: 'Generic';

  "boundary_token"
    The token used to signify a paragraph boundary. Has to be something that
    would never appear in your inputs. Defaults to "\x1B", the ASCII escape
    character.

METHODS
  "new"
    This is the constructor. It accept the attributes specified in
    "ATTRIBUTES".

  "run"
    Run the application according to the command line arguments.

  "learn"
    Takes a line of UTF-8 encoded text as input and learns from it.

  "train"
    Takes a filename and calls "learn" on all its lines. Lines are expected
    to be UTF-8 encoded.

  "reply"
    Takes a line of text and generates a reply (UTF-8 encoded) that might be
    relevant.

  "save"
    Tells the underlying storage backend to save its state.

ETYMOLOGY
    *Hailo* is a portmanteau of *Hal* and <*failo*>
