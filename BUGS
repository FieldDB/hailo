* Save Tokenizer setting to the database

We only save the order and not the tokenizer to the database. Save it
and warn if the user tries to use it like e.g. this:

    hailo --train file.trn --brain file.sqlite --tokenizer Chars
    hailo --brain file.sqlite --tokenizer Words --reply foo

* Add utils/random-names to synopsis/usage example

This is a very useful and easy to show use case of Hailo.

* Show Bot::Training in --help output

Getting started with e.g. the MegaHAL training file is nice.

* Add --random-reply

Due to how MX::Getopts works we can't have '--reply' and '--reply foo'
so we don't expose $hailo->reply($str) v.s. $hailo->reply() to
generate a random reply.

Add a --random-reply to rectify this. There's untested work for this
on the hailo-command-random-reply branch.
